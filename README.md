# Opinion-Poll-System-Java-RMI

Using RMI (Remote Method Invocation), write an application for a prototype opinion poll system. Assume that only one issue is being polled. Respondents may choose yes, or no. Write a client-server application to accept the votes, keep the tally (in memory), and provide the current counts to those who are interested.

Note: You do not need to make a number of client programs. Make one server and one client programs. Keep the server running and run the client several times. For example I run the client three times as follows. Note that this is just a sample example. Your answer must work for any number of clients:

Output:

Enter port: What is your vote?[yes|no] : yes

Yes = 1; No = 0

Enter port: What is your vote?[yes|no] : no

Yes = 1; No = 1

Enter port: What is your vote?[yes|no] : no

Yes = 1; No = 2
